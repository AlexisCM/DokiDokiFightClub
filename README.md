*Doki Doki Fight Club* (DDFC) is a three-dimensional (3D) online game in which players are against one another in a 1v1 fight to the death. DDFC will utilize Fitbit smartwatches to monitor player heart rates (HRs). The HRs will be translated into heartbeat sound effects that the enemy can hear if they are in proximity. Players who can manage their feelings of fear and keep their HR low will gain an advantage over their opponents by being less detectable.
